                    Please check your spam email if you can't find it. You might also have typed your cid/email incorrectly.

                <p>
                    If you're certain that you've entered your CID or email correctly but still haven't received the password recovery email,
                    it could be due to a rate limit. If you suspect this to be the case, please reach out to ita@chalmers.it for further assistance.
