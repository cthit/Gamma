## Build setup

### For production

it's real easy. Just replace the environment variables with suitable value (see wiki)
and run:

`docker-compose -f prod.docker-compose.yml up --build`

Depending on your build system, things might be different, and a proxy is probably needed for a real production version of Gamma.

### Development

run

`docker-compose up --build` to build the frontend, backend, database, databasemonitoring, and all microservices that's needed for Gamma.
 
If developing on the backend, we recomend not running the backend in the docker-compose file. There is a docker-compose file that sets up all microservice but the backend, to use this run: `docker-compose -f no_backend.docker-compose.ym up --build`
then you will need to start the server, this is done by running the Java code in the backend, and is probably best done through an IDE.

You'll need to run `docker-compose down` if you want to try the production build. Same if you're going from production to development.
